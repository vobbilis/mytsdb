# TEST_INFRASTRUCTURE_FIX_PLAN.md — Shim

This placeholder exists so tooling can still reference the legacy planning doc.
The canonical notes now live in:
- `docs/planning/HTTP_QUERY_INVESTIGATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/planning/OTEL_GRPC_PERFORMANCE_TESTING_READINESS.md`
- `docs/planning/OTEL_GRPC_PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_ANALYSIS.md`

Remove this file once the tooling no longer requests it.
