# StorageImpl Agent Task List (Corrected) — Shim

Cursor still references this legacy doc, so this placeholder restores the path.
Actual task tracking now lives in:
- `docs/planning/STORAGEIMPL_AGENT_TASK_LIST.md`
- `docs/planning/HTTP_QUERY_INVESTIGATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/planning/OTEL_GRPC_PERFORMANCE_TESTING_READINESS.md`
- `docs/planning/OTEL_GRPC_PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_ANALYSIS.md`

Keep this file until tooling stops requesting it.
