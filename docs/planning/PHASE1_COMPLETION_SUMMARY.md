# PromQL Engine Phase 1 Completion Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **Lexer Implementation** - Implemented in `src/tsdb/prometheus/promql/lexer.h` and `lexer.cpp`
   - Defined `TokenType` enumeration for all PromQL tokens
   - Created `Token` struct with positional information for better error reporting
   - Implemented `Lexer` class with methods to tokenize PromQL queries
   - Added comprehensive support for operators, literals, keywords, and comments
   - Added support for lookahead with `GetPosition` and `SetPosition` methods

2. **AST Node Definitions** - Implemented in `src/tsdb/prometheus/promql/ast.h` and `ast.cpp`
   - Created base `ExprNode` interface
   - Implemented concrete AST node types:
     - `NumberLiteralNode`, `StringLiteralNode`
     - `VectorSelectorNode`, `MatrixSelectorNode`
     - `BinaryExprNode`, `UnaryExprNode`, `ParenExprNode`
     - `CallNode`, `AggregateExprNode`, `SubqueryExprNode`
   - Added `model::LabelMatcher` to support vector selectors

3. **Parser Implementation** - Implemented in `src/tsdb/prometheus/promql/parser.h` and `parser.cpp`
   - Created `ParserError` class for error reporting
   - Implemented `Parser` class using Pratt parsing technique
   - Added support for operator precedence and associativity
   - Implemented parsing logic for all node types
   - Enhanced infix expression parsing to handle matrix selectors and subqueries
   - Implemented handling of offset and @ modifiers
   - Added subquery expression parsing

4. **Unit Tests** - Implemented in `src/tsdb/prometheus/tests/promql_parser_test.cpp`
   - Added comprehensive tests for lexer functionality
   - Added tests for parser with various PromQL constructs
   - Added error handling tests
   - Added tests for matrix selectors
   - Added tests for subquery expressions
   - Added tests for offset and @ modifiers
   - Tested error handling and reporting for invalid expressions

## Issues Fixed

1. **Compilation Errors**
   - Fixed initialization of `VectorSelectorNode` Token members
   - Fixed `ParserError` class and updated test file to use `what()` instead of non-existent `message()` method
   - Moved `Precedence` enum to public scope in Parser class
   - Added `[[maybe_unused]]` attributes to placeholder method parameters
   - Removed unused variables causing compilation warnings

2. **Test Build Issues**
   - Modified `test/CMakeLists.txt` to link directly against GTest instead of tsdb_test_common
   - Added necessary include paths for test compilation

3. **Parser Functionality Improvements**
   - Enhanced infix expression parsing to handle matrix selectors
   - Implemented subquery expression parsing
   - Added lookahead functionality to distinguish between matrix selectors and subqueries
   - Implemented offset and @ modifier parsing
   - Improved error reporting

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. Implement the Semantic Analyzer
2. Define query plan nodes
3. Implement Query Planner
4. Add unit tests for analyzer and planner

The completion of Phase 1 provides a solid foundation for parsing PromQL queries into a structured Abstract Syntax Tree. With our enhanced testing, we've verified that the implementation correctly handles a wide range of PromQL constructs, including complex expressions, matrix selectors, subqueries, and modifiers.
