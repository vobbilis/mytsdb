# StorageImpl Integration Plan (Shim)

This placeholder file exists so that Cursor's Apply/Accept workflows can access
legacy planning docs that were previously removed. The actual integration plan
now lives in the consolidated storage planning documents described below.

## Canonical Docs

- `docs/planning/HTTP_QUERY_INVESTIGATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/planning/OTEL_GRPC_PERFORMANCE_TESTING_READINESS.md`
- `docs/planning/OTEL_GRPC_PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_ANALYSIS.md`

Please keep new integration tasks in those canonical docs. Remove this shim only
when tooling no longer references it.
