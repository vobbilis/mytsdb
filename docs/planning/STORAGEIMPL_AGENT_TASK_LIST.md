# StorageImpl Agent Task List

This document mirrors the copy inside the Cursor worktree so that tooling like
"Apply All" has the expected file in both locations. The canonical notes have
already been migrated into the other planning docs listed below; keep this
placeholder until Cursor stops referencing it.

## Canonical Planning Docs

- `docs/planning/OTEL_GRPC_PERFORMANCE_TESTING_READINESS.md`
- `docs/planning/OTEL_GRPC_PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_ANALYSIS.md`
- `docs/planning/HTTP_QUERY_INVESTIGATION_SUMMARY.md`

## Placeholder Tasks

1. Validate StorageImpl readiness.
2. Track HTTP verification fixes.
3. Continue OTEL gRPC performance optimization work.
