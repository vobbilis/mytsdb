# PROMQL Engine Implementation Plan — Shim

This placeholder exists solely so tooling referencing the legacy PROMQL plan can
finish applying worktrees. The actual design notes now live in the current
planning docs:
- `docs/planning/HTTP_QUERY_INVESTIGATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/planning/OTEL_GRPC_PERFORMANCE_TESTING_READINESS.md`
- `docs/planning/OTEL_GRPC_PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_ANALYSIS.md`

Keep this shim until Cursor stops requesting the old path.
