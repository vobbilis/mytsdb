/**
 * @file object_pool.cpp
 * @brief Object pooling implementation for memory-efficient resource management
 * 
 * This file implements object pools for frequently allocated/deallocated
 * objects in the TSDB system. Object pooling reduces memory allocation
 * overhead and improves performance by reusing objects instead of
 * constantly creating and destroying them.
 * 
 * The implementation provides three main object pools:
 * 1. TimeSeriesPool - For core::TimeSeries objects
 * 2. LabelsPool - For core::Labels objects  
 * 3. SamplePool - For core::Sample objects
 * 
 * Each pool features:
 * - Thread-safe operations with mutex protection
 * - Configurable initial and maximum pool sizes
 * - Statistics tracking for performance monitoring
 * - Automatic object cleanup and reuse
 * - Memory-efficient object management
 * 
 * Benefits:
 * - Reduced memory allocation overhead
 * - Improved cache locality
 * - Better garbage collection performance
 * - Predictable memory usage patterns
