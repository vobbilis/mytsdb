Current Status and Remaining Tasks
================================

‚úÖ Completed Tasks:
-----------------
1. Created protocol buffer generation script (tools/proto/generate.sh)
2. Created initial protocol buffer definition (src/tsdb/proto/tsdb.proto)
3. Fixed HTTP server test configuration issues
4. Added missing error types (InvalidTimeRangeError, InvalidMatcherError)
5. Updated MockStorage to properly inherit from Storage interface
6. Fixed unused parameter warnings in HTTP server test

üîÑ In Progress:
-------------
1. Build is still failing - need to check remaining errors

‚ùå Remaining Tasks:
----------------
1. Fix labels_test.cpp issues:
   - Need to check if the MockStorage implementation matches the LabelsHandler expectations
   - Verify that the test is properly using the Storage interface methods

2. Verify Protocol Buffer Generation:
   - Ensure generated files are properly included in the build
   - Check if any additional protocol buffer dependencies need to be configured

3. Build System:
   - Verify CMake configuration for all components
   - Check if any additional dependencies need to be added to CMakeLists.txt

4. Testing:
   - Run all tests once build is successful
   - Fix any test failures that may appear

Next Steps:
----------
1. Run the build again with VERBOSE=1 to see the complete error output
2. Focus on fixing the labels_test.cpp issues
3. Verify protocol buffer generation and integration
4. Complete final build and test verification

Note: The build was interrupted in the last attempt, so we need to run it again to see the complete error output.
